# Kryptik
by **@KrishSkywalker**
> Under development

Kryptik is a web app built on Node.JS and has implementations of ciphers and encryption-decryption techniques. 

You may use it to encrypt and decrypt the following ciphers -

- **Baconian** Cipher
- **Caesar shift** Cipher
- **Playfair** Cipher
- Our homebrewed **kWerty** Cipher

### Installation steps
Make sure you have
```npm``` installed, then run the following command in your CLI to install all the dependencies and node modules

```npm install```

The dependencies used are - 

- Pug.js (Earlier known as Jade) as the pre-processor for HTML
- Gulp.js as the streaming build system
